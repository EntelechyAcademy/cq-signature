# Guide > Directory Structure > Constants

We use Constants throughout the application in place of magic strings and other values.

This directory is for storing global constants that aren't related to any specific feature of the application. For those
that are related to features, they should go under a `constants` directory in the relevant feature, under `~/features`.
