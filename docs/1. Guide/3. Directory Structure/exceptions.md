# Guide > Directory Structure > Exceptions

We use Exceptions throughout the application to help us handle errors and show the right messages and error codes to the user.

This directory is for storing global Exceptions that aren't related to any specific feature of the application. For those
that are related to features, they should go under an `exceptions` directory in the relevant feature, under `~/features`.
