# Documentation

Hello, and welcome to the Documentation.

These docs are split into 3 sections: Getting Started, Guide and Examples.

Getting Started has all the information you need to install and run the software locally. It may also contain migration guides or anything extra information related to running the application.

The Guide aims to be a logical journey through the sections of this application, breaking each of them down into bite-sized increments.

The Examples aim to show you how to implement common problems, sometimes reaching across features within an application.

Note that the `~/features` directory is unique, in that each feature has its own Documentation.
